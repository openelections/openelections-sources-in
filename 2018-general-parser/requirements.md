This parser has been tested successfully on the Clay, Shelby, Dubios, Marshall (all 2018) Statement of Votes General Election pdf files. It can be used for pdf files that are formatted such that: 


## Requirements 
1. Table package (included in folder)
2. Utilities package (included in folder)
3. pdftotext package (https://pypi.org/project/pdftotext/)
4. re library (https://docs.python.org/3/library/re.html)
5. os library (https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html)
6. csv library (https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html)

Install either custom package by typing  `pip install .` in your terminal (make sure you are in the directory with both folders and the setup.py file).
